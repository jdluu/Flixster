# Flix
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).


## Flix Part 2

### User Stories

#### Initial

- [x] Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity.
- [x] Allow video posts to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
- [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### Additonal
- [x] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
- [x] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
- [x] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic] for each image during loading
- [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
